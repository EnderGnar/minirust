#[test]
/// This test is written in response to a bug that was found.
/// The bug was: When handing over a lock instead of making the lock owned by the acquiring thread
/// it was once again owned by the releasing thread.
/// This lead to UB once the acquirer tried to release the lock.
/// 
/// What it wants to check is: Does the lock handover work correctly?
/// By making the critical section large (256 times around a loop)
/// we get a high probability that the handover happened.
